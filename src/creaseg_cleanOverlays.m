% This software is a computer program whose purpose is to evaluate the 
% performance of different level-set based segmentation algorithms in the 
% context of image processing (and more particularly on biomedical 
% images).
% 
% The software has been designed for two main purposes. 
% - firstly, CREASEG allows you to use six different level-set methods. 
% These methods have been chosen in order to work with a wide range of 
% level-sets. You can select for instance classical methods such as 
% Caselles or Chan & Vese level-set, or more recent approaches such as the 
% one developped by Lankton or Bernard.
% - finally, the software allows you to compare the performance of the six 
% level-set methods on different images. The performance can be evaluated 
% either visually, or from measurements (either using the Dice coefficient 
% or the PSNR value) between a reference and the results of the 
% segmentation.
%  
% The level-set segmentation platform is citationware. If you are 
% publishing any work, where this program has been used, or which used one 
% of the proposed level-set algorithms, please remember that it was 
% obtained free of charge. You must reference the papers shown below and 
% the name of the CREASEG software must be mentioned in the publication.
